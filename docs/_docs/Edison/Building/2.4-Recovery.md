## Flashall (old image)
If at any point you messed up the Edison or want to go back to the factory state, you need to flash the original image. The image actually consists of several parts, i.e. u-boot (boot loader), ifwi (intel firmware binaries), kernel and root file system. It should not be necessary except after you did Recovery (see below), but just in case of emergency you can download an [Edison 2.1 image](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B272plWyW_YWcTlhX1IyZ0xDLUk) here.

1.  Ungzip the file

2.  Run sudo ./flashall.sh

## Recovery
As described above, u-boot can update itself. However, if u-boot itself is broken (you built a non-functioning image) interrupted flashing, or whatever, it won't boot, and consequently won't be able to re-flash it self.

Fortunately, u-boot is loaded by the PSH KERNEL (microkernel), and this can flash a new u-boot. For this the flashall script needs to be run with an option:

        sudo ./flashall.sh --recovery

The script will be requiring another tool, xfstk for which you can download the sources here: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/xfstk/files/?source=navbar](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xfstk/files/?source=navbar). Unfortunately this has not been updated since 2015-05-14. I found I needed to build that for an old version of Ubuntu, which on installation required an old library package. If you are in need of recovery, you must likely are in a hurry to fix things, so I provide a pre-packaged [xfstk](binaries/xfstk-downloader-0.0.0.ubuntu12.04-amd64.deb) together with the required [library](binaries/libboost-program-options1.46.1_1.46.1-7ubuntu3_amd64.deb) that together install on the amd64 (64 bits version of) Ubuntu 17.04 (Zesty).

To install on Ubuntu:

        sudo dpkg -i libboost-pro*
        sudo dpkg -i xfstk*

After, installing flashall recovery should work.
