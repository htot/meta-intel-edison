### 6.1 Building U-boot from within Yocto

Starting from pyro64 U-Boot can be built directly from Yocto.

The command is:

        bitbake -R conf/u-boot.conf lib32-u-boot

This uses a seperate `u-boot.conf` file, that installs multilib, and then builds the 32 bit version of U-Boot (not really, U-Boot is mixed 32/64 bit code, but requires a certain library that is only available in this manner).

The procedure for installing then exactly the same as [[6.2 Build and Flash U-Boot outside of Yocto|6.2 Build and Flash U-Boot outside of Yocto]]
