## Building U-Boot using Yocto
U-Boot is built automatically as part of the image building, see Building and installing the image. The recipe will be provide the latest U-Boot with `acpi` patches provided if required by the kernel (see ACPI or no-ACPI).

## Building U-Boot manually outside of Yocto
### Background
{% include note.html content="The following instructions are provided by Andy Shevshenko (0andriy) on the Edison community page [https://communities.intel.com/message/432172#432172](https://communities.intel.com/message/432172#432172). They are currently out of date, but provided here for reference purposes. Keep in mind at present there is a `edison` and a `edison-acpi` branch." %}
{% include warning.html content="This work is not yet complete. However Andy is able to build a special version of u-boot with minimal amount of patches (already applied) that is able **(and needed)** to boot a vanilla Linux kernel (x86 and amd64) from v4.7 and higher. " %}

He also provides a kernel with patches applied to run on Edison out of the box.

See:

* [https://communities.intel.com/thread/75472](https://communities.intel.com/thread/75472 "vanilla linux") (Intel forum on getting vanilla linux to work on Edison).
* [https://communities.intel.com/thread/107935](https://communities.intel.com/thread/107935 "u-boot") (Intel forum on updating u-boot)

The status is being tracked here:

### Instructions for building
  * Clone u-boot from [https://github.com/andy-shev/u-boot/tree/edison](https://github.com/andy-shev/u-boot/tree/edison)
  * The current version is edison-v2017.05

        git clone git@github.com:andy-shev/u-boot.git
        cd u-boot
        git checkout edison-v2017.05  

  * To build:

        make clean
        make edison_defconfig
        make -j8

  * If you never updated U-Boot you are still on **v2014.04**. In this case, or if you have **edison-v2016.11**, or **edison-v2017.01** you need to do:

        truncate -s %4096 u-boot.bin

    otherwise skip this step.  
## Flashing only u-boot
To flash the Edison Arduino board you need 2 USB connections.

1.  Connect the first USB cable to the USB port marked as 3 in the photograph below.  
    This cable will be your serial connection to the Edison. To connect to the edison you might use a terminal emulator like gtkterm. The serial port is probably /dev/ttyUSB0 and the baud rate is 115200 with parity none. If you prefer the command line you can use `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`.
    
2.  The second cable to attach goes to the USB port marked as 2 in the photograph below.  
    This port is a special port that can act as USB host or USB slave of which only one is active at a time. As you will be connecting to a host port of your PC, it needs to be configured as slave on the Edison. Push the switch down in the direction of the micro USB ports so that the port is enabled.

3.  On Ubuntu you might need to install the package `dfu-util`.
    
4.  Press the reset button (under the text RESET in the picture above).
    
5.  In your terminal press the ESC key to interrupt the boot process.

6.  You will probably see:

        U-Boot 2014.04 (Jun 06 2016 - 14:40:07)

        Don't forget for 2014.04 you need to apply `truncate` as decribed above.

7.  In your terminal type at the `boot>` prompt:

        run do_force_flash_os

8.  In a second terminal window:

        sudo dfu-util -v -d 8087:0a99 --alt u-boot0 -D u-boot.bin

    This will flash u-boot to the u-boot0 partition. In the first terminal window you may watch the flashing to complete.
