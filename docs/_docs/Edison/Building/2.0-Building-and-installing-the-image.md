### Building the image

Change to the correct directory as instructed by the `make setup` script (see Setting up).

        cd /.../my_Edison_Workspace/test/out/linux64

        source poky/oe-init-build-env

Note: you need to source `oe-init-build-env` from every new konsole that you want to use to run bitbake.

        bitbake -k edison-image

Alternatively, from the same directory as `make setup`:

        make image

`make image` has the advantage that it will always clean and rebuild kernel and U-Boot.



> If you are changing kernel or U-Boot configs that will be a necessary thing to do. But if you are just working on recipies that will appear on the rootfs, using `bitbake` directly will be quicker. Also `bitbake -k` will continue building as many recipies as possible when errors are encountered, which can be convenient during development.

The results of bitbake will be found in `out/current/build/tmp/deploy/images/edison/` which is what we will be using when installing manually to enable booting from SDHC or USB drive.

`make image` will in addition run the `postbuild.sh` script, which will create a complete image in `out/current/build/toFlash/` ready for flashing using `flashall` or `Flash Tool Lite`.

### Flashing the image

Instruction for flashing the complete image will appear here.
