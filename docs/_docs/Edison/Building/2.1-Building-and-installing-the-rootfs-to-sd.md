The following procedure is useful during development. Instead of flashing all to the Edison eMMC the rootfs goes on an external SDHC or USB disk. This has the advantage that you will alsways have a bootable system from which you can inspect or modify stuf preventing your experimental system from booting. And if not, you can pull the disk and fix from your PC.

> The disk is ext4 formated, so will be most easily accessed from a Linux system.

### Building the rootfs

Change to the correct directory as instructed by the `make setup` script.

        cd /.../my_Edison_Workspace/test/out/linux64

        source poky/oe-init-build-env

Note: you need to source `oe-init-build-env` from every new konsole that you want to use to run bitbake.

        bitbake -k edison-image

Alternatively, from the same directory as `make setup`:

        make image

or `make flash` (dizzy only), `make sdk`, see further on.

### Installing the rootfs on a sd card
You will find the image here:

        tmp/deploy/images/edison

The rootfs is `edison-image-edison.ext4`. This you can write to your sdcard.

Note: the device should not be mounted when writing to /dev/sdX. Please check if mounted in advance:

        mount

And if necessary unmount:

        sudo umount /dev/sdX

Take care: the following command will erase everything on your sdcard:

        sudo sh -c 'cat edison-image-edison.ext4 >/dev/sdc' && sync

> Note: all over the internet you will find the following or similar which will do exactly the same, except substantially slower:

        sudo dd bs=1M if=edison-image-edison.ext4 of=/dev/sdX && sync

Make absolutely sure you know the device representing the sdcard, on my system it was `/dev/sdb`.

You need to check, repair and resize the disk after this. You can use GParted for this. On the command line it is:

        sudo e2fsck -f -y -v -C 0 /dev/sdX

and

        sudo resize2fs -p /dev/sdX

### Booting the rootfs on the external disk
The external disk probably has a different kernel as the one on your eMMC. The kernel modules will be mostly on the rootfs. So, to boot the external rootfs you will probably need to have the associated kernel boot first. These need to be installed manually, we the section Building and installing the kernel.
