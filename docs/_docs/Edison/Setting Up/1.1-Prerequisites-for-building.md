## Building Dizzy branches

You *really* need to build Yocto Dizzy versions on Ubuntu 14.04. 

With Dizzy and Ubuntu 16.10 you will get errors related to makenod etc from pseudo-native. that will prevent the image to build completely. 

If you have a later version of Ubuntu you can net native build speeds by creating a container with Ubuntu 14.04, install and configure sshd, create a user for yourself, and install the required build environment (may be a bit to much):

    sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 libsdl1.2-dev xterm python3

Detailed Intel instruction are here: [https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/593591](https://software.intel.com/en-us/node/593591)

How-to create a container: [https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/)

## Building Morty, Pyro and Rocko branches

Yocto Morty / Pyro / Rocko will build on Ubuntu Artful (17.10), despite a warning that this is untested.

Install the required build environment (may be a bit to much):

    sudo apt-get install gawk wget git-core diffstat unzip texinfo gcc-multilib build-essential chrpath socat cpio python python3 libsdl1.2-dev xterm python3

## Building under Windows (10)

### Ubuntu for Windows

I have tried building using Ubuntu for Windows, with no succes. Appearently Windows translation layer does not fully support all properties of a linux file system.

### Virtualbox

If you want to get started quickly, you are probably better off installing a virtual machine (like Virtualbox) with a suitable version of Ubuntu (I don't want to start a flame war, but Kubuntu is really nice). Keep in mind that bitbake will produce 60GB - 100GB of files and a virtual machine will be substantially slower than building native. And native can take 2.5 (ssd) - 6 (hdd) hours when building all from scratch.

### CROss PlatformS (CROPS)

CROPS uses Docker Containers, on Windows this is done by running a linux kernel in a Virtual Machine (VM) then running containers in linux. In the end it is still a VM, which associated slowness, but without the desktop that Virtualbox provides.

 1. Go to the [Docker Installation website](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) and download Docker for Windows (Stable). Docker is a software container platform that you need to install on the host development machine. 

 2. Set Up the Containers to Use the Yocto Project. Go to [CROPS on github](https://github.com/crops/docker-win-mac-docs/wiki) and follow the directions for your particular development host (i.e. Linux, Mac, or Windows).

    Once you complete the setup instructions for your machine, you have the Poky, Extensible SDK, and Toaster containers available.
