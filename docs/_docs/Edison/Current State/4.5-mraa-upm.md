MRAA and UPM are libraries that simplify the development of applications that interface with sensors.
Documentation can be found [here](http://upm.mraa.io/Documentation/docindex.html).

## MRAA
MRAA 1.9 is installed and built to support python3 and nodejs.

{% include note.html content="For the ACPI enabled image MRAA functions related to pin configuration will fail due to pin numbering being replaced by pin naming. MRAA needs to be updated for the ACPI enabled platform. Currently for the ACPI enabled image we recommend to use `libgpiod`" %}

High speed uart (HSU) works. I2C should be working but I haven't tested that yet with real hardware using MRAA. 

Settings GPIO's works with the non-ACPI image only.

Selecting a pinmux on vanilla linux is supposed to be done by devicetree or ACPI, which has been disabled that in mraa for Linux kernels > 4.0. Currently we have I2C, SPI and HSU selectable configurations available in the form of ACPI tables. For the non-ACPI image, I2C and HSU pinmuxes are preset in the platform code in the kernel. 

## UPM
UPM 1.6 is installed.
