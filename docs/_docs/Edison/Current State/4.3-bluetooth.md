## Bluetooth attach

{% include note.html content="This section applies only to the non-acpi enabled image." %}
To get bluetooth working, you first need to attach it with the following command:

    systemctl start bluetooth_attach

To enable it by default:
   
    systemctl start bluetooth_attach

{% include warning.html content="Do not use hciattach!" %}
This is an important step as it powers on the bluetooth module and causes the kernel to load the firmware. The device will be unpowered when btattach terminates.

## Unblock the bluetooth device
Bluetooth may be soft blocked. To unblock:
    
    root@edison:~# rfkill list
    
    0: phy0: wlan
             Soft blocked: no
             Hard blocked: no
    1: hci0: bluetooth
             Soft blocked: yes
             Hard blocked: no
    root@edison:~# rfkill unblock 1
    root@edison:~# rfkill list
    0: phy0: wlan
             Soft blocked: no
             Hard blocked: no
    1: hci0: bluetooth
             Soft blocked: no
             Hard blocked: no

Check the logs for the following:

    dmesg | grep -i blue

## Controlling bluetooth
To connect to other devices use: `bluetoothctl`

    root@edison:~# systemctl start bluetooth
    root@edison:~# bluetoothctl
    [NEW] Controller 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC edison [default]
    Agent registered
    [bluetooth]# discoverable on
    Changing discoverable on succeeded
    [CHG] Controller 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC Discoverable: yes
    [bluetooth]# pairable on
    Changing pairable on succeeded
    [bluetooth]# scan on
    Discovery started
    [CHG] Controller 43:34:1B:00:1F:AC Discovering: yes
    [NEW] Device 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34 00-0A-3A-71-BA-34
    [bluetooth]# connect 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34
    Attempting to connect to 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34
    [CHG] Device 00:0A:3A:71:BA:34 Connected: yes

and follow the instructions in [Intel Edison Bluetooth Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/dam/support/us/en/documents/edison/sb/edisonbluetooth_331704007.pdf)

## Serial communication over bluetooth

I have succeeded in paring 2 BT 4.0 devices and failed in paring a BT 2.0 device. I was able to get a wireless terminal using the following command on the Edison:

    rfcomm watch /dev/rfcomm0 3 /sbin/agetty -L 115200 rfcomm0 xterm-256color

and on the client (laptop):

    sudo rfcomm bind /dev/rfcomm0 ##:##:##:##:##:## 3

    screen /dev/rfcomm0 115200
